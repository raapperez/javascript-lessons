# Javascript Basics

### The language

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, object-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted client-side programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. (wikipedia)

Javascript can also be used in backend development with Node.js

### Homework

1. Write a function that receives two numbers *a* and *b* and prints all numbers between *a* and *b* if a < b or do nothing if b >= a.
1. Write a function that returns the nth element of a fibonacci sequence. A fibonacci sequence is a sequence where the nth element is a sum of the previous 2 elements. The first two elements are 1. Example:
1st: 1, 2nd: 1, 3rd: 2, 4th: 3, 5th: 5, 6th: 8, 7th: 12
